## Introduction

Hi, I'm Marc De Jesus. I’m a full-stack developer with a strong passion for mobile and web development. I have experience working with SwiftUI, React Native, modern JavaScript web frameworks, Node.js and Express, Django, Firebase, and more.

I prefer Django for backend development due to its smooth development experience and powerful built-in admin interface. I’m also a strong advocate for Python-based backends because of Python’s extensive ecosystem for data analytics, machine learning, and scalable application development.

For the frontend, I enjoy working with JavaScript frameworks such as Next.js for the web, and I prefer native mobile development using Swift and Kotlin to take full advantage of platform-specific APIs like Apple HealthKit.
